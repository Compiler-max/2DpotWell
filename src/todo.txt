today toDo:
	- velos on dense mesh


	- Peierls substitution


	- please remember that the obtained conn etc. are now on the interpolated grid, this means the polarization, etc. routines might need adjusting












todo:
	

	- documentation

	
	- test 2D integration routine
	- check weird bug with writting the bwfs in solveHam again
	

	- plotting: mark atoms in the bwf and wnf plots

	- git (online)
	- build on cluster
	- on cluster: convergence tests


	-polarization:
		via Wannier centers
		via Connection (real & k space version) 
		units
	


	DEBUG:

	- compare interpolated energy bands with original energy bands
	- complet new kpts array notsation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



	-first order polarization
		via Niu		-> debug indices seem to point in x not in y direction currtently
		via Peierl

	- peierls
		watch out for chern insulator breakdown
		shift wannier functions instead of solving model again














BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
