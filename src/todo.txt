tomorrow do:
	- calculate velocity operator matrix elements
	- finish nius first order pol
	- debug zero order pol calcualtion





other stuff:
	- git (online)

	
	- write test for boundary condition of polarization -> use unk boundary condition
	- test 2D integration routine

	- check weird bug with writting the bwfs in solveHam again
	



	
	- plotting: mark atoms in the bwf and wnf plots


	
	- curvature:
		calcualation routine

	

	DEBUG:

	- connection:
		via projected states directly -> still not the correct value, try interpolation, might be related to bad FD on coarse mesh
		via unk generated from wannier functions (INTERPOLATION)

	-polarization:
		via Wannier
		via Connection

	



	-first order polarization
		via Niu
		via Peierls

	







	- peierls
		watch out for chern insulator breakdown

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
