tomorrow do:



	- git








	
	- write test for boundary condition of polarization


	- check weird bug with writting the bwfs in solveHam again
	
	- plotting: band structure (k point path?), mark atoms in the bwf and wnf plots


	- test 2D integration routine


	-polarization:
		via Wannier
		via Connection

	-first order polarization
		via Niu
		via Peierls

	- peierls
		watch out for chern insulator breakdown

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
