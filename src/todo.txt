today toDo:
	
	
	- blas in mathematics/myMatInvSqrt in genWann

	- raum buchen fÃ¼r vortrag

	- normalization of loBwf for different number of k points


	

	- Rcell generation problem does not start with (0,0) at the moment
	

	- maybe try a manual gauging method aswell (different trial orbitals seem to change polarization direction completly) 
	- seem like the trial orbital method is responsible for the shitty values
	-> 	do a manual gauging !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


	- version without gauge trafo
	- version without interpolation : 
	- try niu and peierl with these quantities


	-velocities via finite difference on unks
	
	- look at wb i.e. the weight of the coarse connection finite differnce approach


	- look at UNKoverlap in berry.f90

	



	- Peierls substitution
		-> after peierls is written, proably remove the blochWF.f90 module (move subroutines back to potWellModel)
		-> peierls changes all the quantities passed to it, so writing them should be done before and after peierls sub!!!!!



	- please remember that the obtained conn etc. are now on the interpolated grid, this means the polarization, etc. routines might need adjusting






todo:
	
	- on cluster: convergence tests

	- documentation

	
	- test 2D integration routine
	- check weird bug with writting the bwfs in solveHam again
	

	- plotting: mark atoms in the bwf and wnf plots


	-polarization:
		units
	


	DEBUG:

	- compare interpolated energy bands with original energy bands
	- complet new kpts array notsation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



	-first order polarization
		via Niu		-> debug indices seem to point in x not in y direction currtently
		via Peierl

	- niu
		see if zero field gives zero pol

	- peierls
		run with zero field should obtain zero order polarization
		watch out for chern insulator breakdown
		shift wannier functions instead of solving model again














BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
