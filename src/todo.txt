today toDo:
	

	- Peierls substitution
		-> after peierls is written, proably remove the blochWF.f90 module (move subroutines back to potWellModel)
		-> peierls changes all the quantities passed to it, so writing them should be done before and after peierls sub!!!!!


	- build on cluster

	- please remember that the obtained conn etc. are now on the interpolated grid, this means the polarization, etc. routines might need adjusting





	- raum buchen fÃ¼r vortrag



	working compiler command for omp:
			 ifort -mkl -qopenmp src/*.f90 thirdparty/config_fortran/m_config.f90 thirdparty/quadpack/intlib.f90 -o bin/a.out

todo:
	
	- on cluster: convergence tests

	- documentation

	
	- test 2D integration routine
	- check weird bug with writting the bwfs in solveHam again
	

	- plotting: mark atoms in the bwf and wnf plots

	- git (online)
	


	-polarization:
		units
	


	DEBUG:

	- compare interpolated energy bands with original energy bands
	- complet new kpts array notsation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



	-first order polarization
		via Niu		-> debug indices seem to point in x not in y direction currtently
		via Peierl

	- niu
		see if zero field gives zero pol

	- peierls
		run with zero field should obtain zero order polarization
		watch out for chern insulator breakdown
		shift wannier functions instead of solving model again














BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
