w90:
	write_tb = true   -> lattice vectors, Hamiltonian & position operator will be written to seedname_tb.dat [units: Angs, eV]

















PEIERLS:
-	needs at least an own calcConnOnCoarse since in UNKoverlaps, the basis coefficients 
	only go up to nWfs
-	debug peierls for zero magnetic field solution should be same as zero pBerry!!!
-	shift currently one even though field is applied!!!


play around
	- calcHtmp: swith U and Udag
	- projection: line 71 calculation of shifted coefficients


- convergence tests:
	- k points berry connection fd
		


- remove wannier interpolation, only coarse mesh calculation




- 	niu debug plus/minus for Fmatrix 
-	velocities - if not matching with peierls, try introduce volume prefactor to veloctities


BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
