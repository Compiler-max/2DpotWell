today toDo:
	- Peierls substitution
	- curvature & connection plot
	- plotting: mark atoms in the bwf and wnf plots


todo:
	

	- documentation

	
	- test 2D integration routine
	- check weird bug with writting the bwfs in solveHam again
	



	- git (online)
	- build on cluster
	- on cluster: convergence tests


	


	DEBUG:

	- connection:
		via projected states directly -> still not the correct value, try interpolation, might be related to bad FD on coarse mesh
		via unk generated from wannier functions (INTERPOLATION)

	-polarization:
		via Wannier
		via Connection
		units
	



	-first order polarization
		via Niu		-> debug indices seem to point in x not in y direction currtently
		via Peierl

	- peierls
		watch out for chern insulator breakdown
		shift wannier functions instead of solving model again














BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
