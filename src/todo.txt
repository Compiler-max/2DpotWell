	- urlaub eintragen (shiff + weihnachten)

	- convergence tests:
		- basis functions: charge density
		- real grid wannier centers 
		- k points berry connection fd
		
	- velocity calculation neu machen ist es vw=Haw oder vw=Haw-dE*Aw
	

-	test linear descending well
	


-	fd connection check without implying periodicity (?!) boundary condition of fd approx



-	modell system with fully y symmetric wannier functions

-	underlying electronic structure as optional,
	read in safed values if switch demands it







BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
