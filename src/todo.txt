 
- remove wannier interpolation, only coarse mesh calculation





PEIERLS:
-	needs at least an own calcConnOnCoarse since in UNKoverlaps, the basis coefficients 
	only go up to nWfs
-	debug peierls for zero magnetic field solution should be same as zero pBerry!!!
-	shift currently one even though field is applied!!!






- convergence tests:
	- k points berry connection fd
		






- 	niu debug plus/minus for Fmatrix 


BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
