CODING:

- 	write wannier function resolved centers to pol Output file

- 	automatically plot band structure	
	
	
	
	
-	 warning readIn of Gvec in berry/readAbiN currently commented(line 182) 
	
	






ANALYSIS:


	- test magnetic hamiltonian 
			1,3, 9 supercells
	
	
	- robustness of analytic velocities,
		-> what influence has the cutoff on the velocities?
	
	
	
	
	
	- compare berry polarization (integral over connection) with w90_centers
		-> write w90_centers to pol file
		-> pol file should be state resolved (only look at displacement!!!)
			- atom and state listed, state 1 's', state 2-3 'p_'
	
	
	
	
	- try to converge a 3 and a 9 cell supercell
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	- compare dH/dk with gradient approach of the velocities
	
	
	
	
	- tool fÃ¼r auswertung der konvergenzruns
			-> pPei vs. (pBerry + pNiu)
			-> velocities (x and y) plot
			-> band structure
			- visualize Gvec




SONSTIGES

	- WANNIERISE VIA LIBRARY MODE	: debug

	- play around with google/xi







































- k convergence - assume converged if useRot does not affect zero order pol anymore

- automatisation: python script which generates subfolders and input files inside subfolders



postW90:
	- read interpolation k mesh from file, similar to fleur, w90

PEIERLS:
-	debug:			 peierls for zero magnetic field solution should be same as zero pBerry!!!



- 	niu debug plus/minus for Fmatrix 
-	velocities - if not matching with peierls, try introduce volume prefactor to veloctities


BEYOND:

	- yuriy also mentioned playing around with non collinearity, talk to frank about that again
		-> maybe only do that in FLEUR
